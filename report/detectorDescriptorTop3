My top3 detector/descriptor are:

1.- Fast detector / Brief descriptor
2,. Fast detector / ORB descriptor
3.- Fas detector / Brisk descriptor

<<these top 3 are in base of detector time and descriptor time thet for all cases is 
not more than 3 secods, other important point is the matched keyPoints number, 
for those detector/ descriptor combination the matched points are aroun 100, 
I think they are enough, and the matcher time is close to 1 second.
